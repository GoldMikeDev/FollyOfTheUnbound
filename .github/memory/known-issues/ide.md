# IDE — Known Issues

Layer-specific quirks for the IDE/Workspaces stack. Load when working under
`src/{Analyzers,CodeStyle,Features,Workspaces,EditorFeatures,VisualStudio,LanguageServer}`.
Cross-cutting issues live in `.github/memory/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

## MEF composition failures surface as test failures

**Affected area:** MEF-dependent IDE/Workspaces tests
**Description:** A missing/incorrect MEF export attribute often manifests as an
unrelated-looking test failure rather than a clear composition error.
**Workaround:** When IDE tests fail unexpectedly, check the export attributes
first (`[ExportLanguageService]`/`[ExportWorkspaceService]`, `[Shared]`,
`[ImportingConstructor]` + `[Obsolete(MefConstruction.ImportingConstructorMessage)]`).

## New loop-like statement kinds need registering in `IsContinuableConstruct`/`IsBreakableConstruct`

**Affected area:** `src/Workspaces/SharedUtilitiesAndExtensions/Compiler/CSharp/Extensions/SyntaxNodeExtensions.cs`
**Description:** `IsContinuableConstruct`/`IsBreakableConstruct` are shared helpers with their own
hardcoded `SyntaxKind` switch, consumed independently by `BreakKeywordRecommender`/
`ContinueKeywordRecommender` (keyword completion) and `LoopHighlighter` (keyword highlighting).
When this fork added `SyntaxKind.DoUntilStatement`, none of the other IDE-support work (classification,
formatting, outlining) touched this file, so `break`/`continue` silently weren't suggested and
weren't highlighted inside `do { } until (...)` loops until this helper was updated — with no error,
crash, or test failure to flag it.
**Workaround:** Any new loop-like statement kind must be added to `IsContinuableConstruct`'s switch
directly; it is not covered by any of the other per-feature registration points. See the
"Adding IDE Support for a New Statement/Expression SyntaxKind" checklist in
`.github/instructions/IDE.instructions.md`.
